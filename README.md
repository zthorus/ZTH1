# ZTH1
The ZTH1 RISC CPU for small computers

The ZTH1 is a simple 16-bit RISC CPU coded in VHDL. It can be
implemented into an FPGA (like the Altera MAX10) to create small
computers. The repository contains the Intel Quartus Prime project to
implement on a Kamami Maximator MAX10 FPGA board a computer based on the
ZTH1, with 8 k-words of instruction ROM and 8 k-words of data RAM
(including the video memory). This computer has an HDMI output to
display 128 x 192 pixel images with 16 colors. The manual (in PDF)
describing the ZTH1 and how to program it is included in this repository.
